Var:
1-Var is globally scoped while Let & Const are block scoped
2-Var can be re-declared or updated
e.g:

var a= 12;
var a= 13;
console.log(a);

As you see we re-declared "var a=13" again 

Let:
1-Let is block scoped
2-Let can updated and not re-declared 
e.g:

let a=13;
let a=14;(re-declared)
a=45;(updated fron 14 to 45)
console.log(a);

Now when we re-declared var a=14; it will show error 'on screen


Const:
1-Const = Constant
2-Const can not updated neither re-declared
